# E-COMMERCE
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data using Power BI, with a strong emphasis on Time Intelligence, particularly Year-to-Date (YTD) analysis. 

🗂️ Project Workflow & Methodology

Data Understanding & Import
1) Imported raw e-commerce sales data into Power BI.
2) Reviewed data structure, key fields, and relationships required for analysis.
3) Ensured the dataset was suitable for time-based calculations and reporting.
   
Data Modeling

1) Designed a proper data model to support accurate analysis.
2) Created relationships between fact and dimension tables.
3) Implemented best practices in data modeling to improve performance and clarity.
   
Calendar Table Creation

1) Created a custom Calendar (Date) table to enable time intelligence functions.
2) Added essential date attributes such as year, month, and date hierarchy.
3) Linked the Calendar table with the sales data to ensure correct time-based calculations.
   
Time Intelligence Analysis (YTD Focus)

1) Implemented Total Year-to-Date (YTD) measures to analyze cumulative performance.
2) Used DAX time intelligence functions to track sales growth over time.
3) Compared current performance against previous periods to identify trends and seasonality.
   
Data Visualization & Dashboard Creation

1) Built interactive dashboards to present YTD sales and performance metrics.
2) Used visuals such as cards, line charts, bar charts, and slicers for dynamic analysis.
3) Designed dashboards to be intuitive, business-friendly, and insight-driven.
